\chapter{Problem 1}
\section{Introduction}
In this document, the online ticket vending machine that is available in Montreal, Canada, will be examined and discussed. The project's goal is to produce a collection of related artifacts for the issue at hand as well as the domain of the software solution for a useable, secure, maintainable, and (environmentally) sustainable TVM. \\\\
The requirements and use cases are recorded in the pictorial representation with the help of problem domain, stakeholders and use case modelling and various other UML diagrams to understand different perspectives of the system.

\section{Description of iGo}
The term "TVM" refers for "Ticket Vending Machine," a self-service kiosk where customers may buy tickets for public transportation, including buses, trains, and subways. TVMs are intended to reduce the need for human interaction and speed up boarding time by making the ticket purchase procedure quick and simple for commuters. \\\\
After drawing inspiration from the present version of the TVM that STM has deployed notably in the metro system of Montreal, Canada, we chose to give alternatives for purchasing a ticket in numerous conceivable ways with our version of iGo. The various possible ways include single trip pass, one-day pass, two-day pass, weekly pass, and monthly pass. Customers may tap their card at any metro station to move effortlessly between different locations with the use of only one electronic fare card. \\\\
Moreover, users of iGo will have access to an online portal to reload their electronic cards and track all transactions from a single location. iGo will also make use of developing technology for making payments via secure channels utilising debit/credit cards.\\\\
With iGO, it is assumed that metro stations and buses have kiosks on which the application will be installed, to scan and validate the electronic tickets. Notwithstanding the fact that there is no provision in iGo for maintaining the existing physical TVMs available at metro stations in Montreal. 
\\\\
At the end of our project, we want to have created software that is useful and with capabilities similar to those of the Montreal metro TVM.  \\\\
iGo will provide a range of services related to purchasing and managing the transit tickets. Some of the services that will be provided include: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ticket purchasing:} iGo will enable users to swiftly and conveniently tickets, minimising the need for human interaction and speeding up boarding time.
  \item \textbf{Ticket type selection:} Users can choose between single trip tickets, day passes, weekly or monthly passes, and other sorts of transit prices.
  \item \textbf{Payment processing:} iGo will accept cash, credit, or debit card payments, and even allow mobile payments like apple pay or phonepe.
  \item \textbf{Ticket printing:} iGo will provide tickets electronic tickets which the user can scan at the metro stations using the kiosks available there.
  \item \textbf{Multilingual support:} As Montreal is a French dominated city hence iGo will provide the support for two major languages namely English and French.
  \item \textbf{Account management:}iGo will allow its users to manage their transit accounts, by reloading or renewing passes, monitoring transaction history, and altering account information.
\end{itemize}
\leavevmode
\\
It should be noted here that implementing the payment gateways for purchasing the tickets is currently not within the scope for this project. However, a Payment option is added which can be extended for realization.
\\


\section{Future Scope}
Considering historical experience, we may anticipate that as Montreal's economy expands, additional stations will be built in the future years.
We will attempt to develop the TVM software so that it will be simple to update and add new needs while keeping these modifications in mind.

\section{Description about Classes}
The domain model consists of the following classes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ticket: }
    This class represents a ticket that can be purchased from the TVM for a means of public transportation. It has the following attributes:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item validityPeriod: the duration for which the ticket is valid
     \item purchaseDate: the Date on which ticket was purchased
     \item payment: the details about the payment of this purchase
    \end{itemize}  
          
    \item \textbf{TicketType: }This class represents the types of tickets that can be purchased from the TVM. 
    It has the following attributes:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item name: the name of the ticket type
        \item description: a description of the ticket type
        \item validityPeriod: the duration for which the ticket is valid
        \item fare: the cost of the ticket
        \end{itemize}
     \end{itemize}   
     
  \item \textbf{Payment: } This class represents a payment made by the user to purchase a ticket from the TVM. It has the following attributes:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item amount: the amount of money paid by the user
    \item paymentMethod: the method used for payment (e.g. cash, credit card, mobile payment
    \item paymentStatus: the current status of the payment (e.g. success, fail) 
  
    
    \item \textbf{User: }  This class represents a user of the TVM system. It has the following attributes:
       \begin{itemize}
       \item  name: the name of the user
        \item email: the email address of the user
        \item password: the password of the user's account
        \item validity: the validity of the user's account
        \end{itemize}
        This class has three subclasses:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Student
        \item General
        \item Senior Citizen
         \end{itemize}
          
     \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{TVM: } This class represents the ticket vending machine itself. It has the following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
\item location: the physical location of the TVM
\item status: the current status of the TVM (e.g. operational, out of order)
\item serialNumber: the unique identifier for the TVM
 \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{ Transaction: } This class represents a transaction made by a user at the TVM to purchase a ticket. It has the following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
\item ticket: the ticket that was purchased
\item payment: the payment made by the user for the ticket
\item user: the user who made the transaction
\item date: the date and time the transaction was made
\item  Machine: the machine used to make the transaction
 \end{itemize}

\section{Description about Relationship among Classes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ticket has a composition relationship with TicketType, as each Ticket is associated with a specific TicketType.
\item Transaction has a composition relationship with Ticket and Payment, as each transaction involves the purchase of a ticket and a payment made by the user.
\item Transaction has an association relationship with User, as each transaction is associated with a specific user.
\item Transaction has an association relationship with TVM, as each transaction is associated with the TVM that was used to make the transaction.
 \end{itemize}

    \caption{Use Case Model for iGo TVM}
    \label{fig:Use_Case_Diagram}
\end{figure}
\\\\

\noindent The iGo Ticket Vending Machine and the commuter or user are the key two actors in the use case model.
The user's use cases include logging in or signing up, choosing a language, purchasing tickets, topping off cards, paying for tickets and cards, and accessing account information, including transaction history and wallet balance.
Whereas iGo will handle the internal connection to the bank and the sorts of tickets that are shown.
In addition to these actors, there are two more: the Bank, which handles the authentication and verification of all credit card and debit card payment transactions, and the negative use case actor, the Hacker, who could attempt to breach the system, steal user data, and exploit it for their own advantage.

\chapter{Problem 5}
\section{Temporal Use Case Modeling: Activity Diagram}
Activity diagrams show how multiple levels of abstraction of activities are coordinated to produce a service. Typically, an event must be accomplished by some operations, especially when the operation is meant to accomplish several different things that call for coordination. Another common requirement is how the events in a single use case relate to one another, especially in use cases where activities may overlap and require coordination. It may also be used to illustrate how a set of related use cases interact together to reflect business operations.\\

\end{figure}
\noindent This activity diagram shows how to examine an access card's remaining balance. The process begins by asking the user to insert the card and then enter a PIN. After that, the control travels to the bank gateway to verify the authorization; if it is successful, the balance is displayed; otherwise, the user is prompted to eject the card.
